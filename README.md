The highlight of the project for me was the API Data as I found it to work the most out of all my tasks. I used the code I did for the previous project as a rough guideline and also decided to create a custom hook. I was working through the advanced react course on codecademy and thought using a custom hook would be a good idea to test my new knowledge.

From the module I learnt that custom hooks are beneficial because they:

-Make code more readable by hiding complex hook logic

-Can help reuse stateful logic between multiple components

For this project, using a custom hook was beneficial because it simplified the component logic, making it cleaner and easier to understand. It also helped by keeping the loading states and error handling in one place.

To create the custom hook, I used resources including Codecademy, Dev Community, and a site called Open Replay. I used examples from these resources to write my code and then used ChatGPT to help me with anything I was missing. I also asked for guidelines on how to write the code rather than a straight answer so I could figure it out on my own. 
Some issues included runtime errors with the API because when I initially started the task, I  fetched the data directly in a functional component. By switching to a custom hook, I was able to isolate the data fetching logic, making it simpler and more reliable. This change helped reduce errors and made the code easier to manage.
I had some trouble remembering syntax for certain things and had to ask for guidance here and there. 
I used resources effectively to complete my tasks, and I also found a good way to utilise ChatGPT without it giving away the code completely by asking for guidelines or syntax structure when I found some parts a bit difficult. 
When completing the tasks I took notes of what parts were most difficult for me to do so I can continue to work on them and improve them post-program by practising and creating my own projects.
